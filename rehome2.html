            you need to ask, please do not hesitate to contact us.

            <label for="main-head">why did you set up petRehomer?</label>
            <div class="mainbar-text">
                <p>we know that sometimes rehoming a dog, cat or rabbit is necessary, 
                    and that it can be a painful decision for the pet owner. by offering a 
                    non-judgemental and straightforward option we make it easier for people 
                    to do the right thing by their pets and themslves. <br><br>
                    our charity offers a viable alternative to unregulated sites like pets4Homes,
                    gumtree, preloved and facebook. this enables us to improve pet welfare and 
                    educate people about responsible rehoming and adoption.

            <label for="main-head1">do i have to pay a fee to rehime my pet through petRehomer?</label>
            <div class="mainbar-text1">
                <p>no. the person adopting your pet will pay a donation instead. the amount they pay is 
                    similar to the adoption fees charged by most rescue centres in the chennai. we think
                    this is the fariest way to go about things.

            <div class="mainbar-text2">
                <p>yes. home checks are areally important part of the process. they allow us to see 
                    if an adopter's home is right for your pet. <br><br>
                    we work with a specialist organisation to carry out our home checks. they will
                    asses the adopter's living environment to make sure it's suitable for the specific
                    needs of your pet. they may also take photos.

                <p>"we have had such an amazing experience using whisker heaven to find
                    somebody to adopt our 7 year old springer x pointer. the website was
                    really easy to use, the team kept in touch to keep us updated on 
                    progress, and they also did marketing in our country to help find him a 
                    new home without having to travel too far. <br>
                    we found an adopter within a week and the vetting process, done by 
                    the whisker heaven team, was very thorough and our dog now has the 
                    perfect new home. it is obviously a very emotional decision and whisker
                    heaven has made it as painless as possible, i can't recommend them 
                    enough!"

                    details for my cat and within a week found a suitable family for her.
                    there was so much communication and reassrance. my cat now has a 
                    lovely new home. they also took food measures in assuring that the
