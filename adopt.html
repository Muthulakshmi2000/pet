                <p>if you are adopting a dog under 8 years old or a cat under 10 years
                    old, you can receive 4 week's free pet insurance from british pet insurance
                    (part of pet cover). <br>
                    you will need to complete the form on the dau of collection, and you will

                <p>we're focusing on dogs, cats and rabbits because they're the most 
                    popular types of pet in the UK. we plan to help rehome other types Of
                    pets in the future.

            <label for="main-head2">i see that some pets listed haven't been neutered or microchipped.
                why is this?</label>
            <div class="mainbar-text2">
                <p>in an ideal world, every pet listed by us would be microchipped and neutered,
                    however we are dealing with real life cases, and not everyone rehoming their 
                    pet is in a position, or willing to do this. <br><br>
                    our charity is operating throughout the UK and does not have the funds to pay
                    for the neutering of pets prior to rehoming. <br><br>
                    instead, rather than turning away these pets in need, we do our very best to 
                    find suitable and responsible adopters who are willing to do the right thing 
                    by these pets. <br><br>
                    it's easy for people to criticize us for allowing unneutered pets onto our website,
                    but sadly there is no easy fix.

                <p>"i recently used whisker heaven to adopt a beautiful cat named arlo!
                    they were brilliant from start to finish. they speak with both parties
                    and make sure everyone is happy, so they really make an effort to 
                    get the right information to recommend what is best for the cat. <br><br>
                    
                    the team were amazing, informative and always on stand by if any questions 
                    are needed. i believe this is a great alternative to getting a cat from 
                    gumtree/facebook etc. with 100% more safely procedures. it also takes the 
                    stress away from the rehomer, as they can be sure effort has been made to 
                    find the best home. <br><br>

                    finally it's a pleasure to be able to help a service, who have a bunch on 
                    wonderful volunteers going out of their way to help our pets. saving alot of 
                    stress on shelters which are usually full up! 10/10 thank you so much!"

                    us was great throughout, and continued once our new dog was with us,
                    making sure he was settled and happy, as well as us. she was very 
                    supportive and reassuring throughout the whole process and we have

                <p>"the charity are amazing and the volunteers are so helpful. they put the 
                    well-being of pets at the forefront, and make sure that they are wellcared for! <br><br>
                    i was originally contacted by colleen about my application for potato 
                    (rabbit) and quickly put in contact with karen for a home check 
                    appointment. soon after i was out in contact with potato's owners and 
                    colleen to further discuss the adoption process and potato. i can't fault
                    this charity in any way at all; very ethical and align with my own morals.i 
                    am gald i used the charity due to their morals and support! "

                <p>"a brilliant service! <br> 
                    yesterday we picked up our new cat, snoop. petRehomer made 
                    everything super easy. we enquired about snoop, got a call back, and
                    submitted our adoption fee to reserve snoop. we got a home 
                    checked booked in really quickly and then were connected to the owner through 
                    petRehomer. <br><br>
                    they were helpful during the whole process and gave advice and 
                    guidance where needed. <br>
                    really happy with the charity's service and so lucky to have our new 
                    addition!!!"

        <h2>straightforward pet rehoming and adoption </h2>
        <p> whisker heaven is a new service that combines great technology with real
            people supporting you behind the scenes. our service connects potential
            adopters with people who need to rehome their pets. this makes it easier
            for good people to adopt the right pet whilst maximising the chance of pets Finding
            their forever home. <br><br>
            our charity offers a non-judgmental service to rehomers and gives them full,
            yet guided, control of the process. <br><br>
            we're also helping to reduce the number of pets going into shelters. this frees up space and
            resources for the pets awho have been abandoned, need immediate help or special
            care.
